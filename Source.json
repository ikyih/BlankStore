We have been very busy with doing quality of life changes and fixing bugs everyone’s been having. WE RECOMMEND FRESH INSTALL ON THIS UPDATE. it took this long as there was some problems that were hard and some things needed fixed before releasing and testing, but this should make sidestore much better to use.

If you’re into even more experimental join our discord and try our ipas we ask for testing. \n\n For people that want to use MDC no3applimit (MacDirtyCow).
